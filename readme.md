 > Here's the scenario. Your company has many internal products it uses to monitor its applications at customer sites. All these products write log files and place them in a special directory. The log files are written in a proprietary format that your company has come up with that can't be parsed by any existing third-party tools. You're tasked with building a product, LogAn, that can analyze these log files and find special cases and events in them. When it finds these cases and events, it should alert the appropriate parties.

Major features: LogAn's parsing, event-recognition, and notification abilities. 

Each chapter is covered in it's own unit folder. At the end we'll have an additional folder completing the whole image.
